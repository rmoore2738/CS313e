# Input: n a positive integer
# Output: a bit string

# Input: s and p are bit strings
# Output: an integer that is the number of times p occurs in s

    print(p)

  # compute the bit string f(n)

  # determine the number of occurrences of p in f(n)

  # print the number of occurrences of p in f(n)
